# Laramenu/AppleBees Menu


Laramenu was createded with the intent to provide knowledge of the basic steps taken when using laravel as a beginner.

The projects was made  in a simple way in order to avoid errors and not create caos in the builder head and its Windows computer. The knowledge provided by this experience has been amazing and has made the creator more familiar with laravel and its magic.
